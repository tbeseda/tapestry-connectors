**Hacker News Front Page**

Create a Feed with this Connector to receive the latest Hacker News stories to hit the front page.

Note: stories are added to the feed at the time they were submitted to Hacker News.
I'm exploring ways to add stories at the time they hit the front page, but the API only provides created and updated times.
